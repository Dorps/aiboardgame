\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the

{problem statement checklist}.}
\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\section{Goals}
\subsection{Product Quality}
The product should allow users to input different game state values, and use AI technology to precisely detect the loopholes of the game. 

\subsection{Ease of use}
The installation process of this product should remain in a minimal time. After installing the program, the end user should understand the manipulation and use the productâ€˜s functionality easily. Our team will also investigate a certain amount of potential users regarding their product feedback and improve the user experience
\subsection{Reusability}
The users can reuse this software product on multiple games which reduces additional cost and time to improve the quality of the software. 
\section{Stretch Goals}
\subsection{Short Time completion}
The completion time of the product should not be longer than the reasonable maximum value. If the input game state value is invalid, it will terminate the program shortly and report an invalid input error.
\subsection{Portability}
The product can be installed and removed from different operating systems which will not damage the game and users' personal computers.
