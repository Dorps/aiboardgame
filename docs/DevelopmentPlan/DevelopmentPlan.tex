\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classificaiton, etc.?
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

The main risk 


What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Python will be used to develop the simulation engine and be used for simulation the AI players. 
The choice of this langauge is due to Python's Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence libraries and the support for
 Object Oriented Programming.
\item To ensure common programming standards, developers will use pylint to maintain the same coding style across files. 
VSCode and prettier will be used for automatic formatting and linting.
\item Pytest will be used for integration and unit testing.
\item Coverage.py will be used for code coverage as it integrates easily with pytest.
\item There are no immediate plans for Continous Integration/Continous Deployment 
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Libraries you will likely be using?
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}
